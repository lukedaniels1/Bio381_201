```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




## More LaTex tricks 

## Summation 
$$\sum_{i=1}^S{n_i}$$

### Sentence text 

$$p(\mbox{Occurrence of Species X}) = 0.67$$

### Escaping the backslash

$$\backslash a \le b \backslash$$



Rendering code of

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(ggplot2)
waterTemp <- runif(50)
planktonAbun <- runif(50)
qplot(x=waterTemp, y=planktonAbun)
# print(waterTemp)
# head(waterTemp)
```

Now we can add text here, say anything we want, ect. because we are no longer in R but back in the world of `markdown`

```{r, eval=TRUE, message= FALSE}
qplot(x=waterTemp)
```
